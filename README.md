Hello Accessibility: Android Accessibility Teaching Tool
==========================================

An extremely simple application built to use as a teaching tool for Accessibility for Android.

The application consists of:
* Two text buttons (one with working default Accessibility and one without)
* One image button
* A custom-drawn view

The application can be used to easily live code accessibility demos, adding labels, etc. to the buttons as well as creating an accessibility container with the custom-drawn view. An example of added AX is found in the [AX branch](https://github.com/spanage/HelloAX-Android/tree/AX) of this project.
